Data Transformation

In the run_analysis script i programmed this steps:
1) Download and read in a dataframe the data: features, activities, train and test (subjects, X coordinate, Y coordinate)
2) Set names to dataframe: features and activities.
3) Merge the train and test data with rbind command.
3) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement using Regular Expression: grep command.
4) Names activity in the data set using features Data
5) Puts all the data together in a dataframe: subjects, x coordinate (train + test), y coordinate (train + test)
6) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
