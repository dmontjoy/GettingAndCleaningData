Project for Coursera:  DataScience Specialization -  Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains 3 files:
Readme,run_analysis.R and Codebook

The run_analysis.R file is an script the produce an aggregate data for the original data set. I document every step in the script. For any questions my email is : dmontjoy@gmail.com

The script downloads the zip data, unzips, names, merges and finally aggregate and create a txt file with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject,
